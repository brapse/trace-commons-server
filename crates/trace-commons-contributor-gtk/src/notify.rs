//! Desktop notifications, which on Linux do the work a tray menu does
//! elsewhere.
//!
//! GNOME has no system tray, so notification actions are the reliable
//! cross-desktop way to reach a contributor who is not looking at the
//! window. That makes what those actions may do the single most important
//! rule in this file:
//!
//! **No notification action may upload anything, ever.** The actions are
//! exactly `Review` -- which opens the window at the queue and nothing else
//! -- and `Not now`, which dismisses. There is no approve, no "send all",
//! no default action that resolves to one. A misfired notification that
//! ships three real transcripts is unrecoverable, and no amount of
//! convenience is worth that risk. The enum below is deliberately the only
//! vocabulary this module has.

/// What a contributor pressed. There is no third variant, and adding one
/// that sends anything would violate the shared spec.
