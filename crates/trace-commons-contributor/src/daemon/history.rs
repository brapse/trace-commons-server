//! Contribution history: what went out, and what it earned.
//!
//! Someone who lets the daemon upload while they are away needs to be able to
//! see what happened without dropping to a terminal. The server already
//! returns everything needed per submission -- status, scopes, pending and
//! final credit, and its own explanation lines -- so this module joins that
//! with the local receipts and caches the result.
//!
//! The daemon owns the polling rather than each application doing its own, so
//! there is one poller instead of three, and history is readable offline from
//! the cache with a staleness marker rather than showing an empty table when
//! the network is down.
//!
//! History records carry **no local path**. This is the surface most likely to
//! be screenshotted, exported, or shared.
