# Operator Runbook — `trace-commons-server`

This directory holds the deployment-shaped knowledge that lets an operator
take `trace-commons-server` from "compiles clean on `main`" to "first pilot
running on real hardware." It is intentionally separate from the architectural
docs (`docs/trace-commons*.md`) and per-slice design specs (`docs/superpowers/specs/`)
which describe *what* the system is. This directory describes *how to run it*.

## Status: outline (2026-05-13)

The outline below names every runbook doc and deployment script that the
pilot-prep PR will land. Brief descriptions; the actual content lands after
the audit-fixes PR merges so the env-var surface is stable.

Use this index as a contents page when the full runbook is filled in.

## Alphabetical reference

Every runbook in this directory, with a one-line description.

- [`./account-merge.md`](./account-merge.md) — device-account consolidation:
  the strong-auth-gated stage-then-execute merge flow, its irreversibility, the
  single-use-link burn gotcha, and the hash-only `account_merge_started` /
  `account_merged` audit surface. Includes the V34 edited-migration note.
- [`./agpl-source-offer.md`](./agpl-source-offer.md) — the AGPL section 13
  source offer at `GET /v1/source`: why it must stay unauthenticated and
  publicly reachable, what it returns, and what changes if you deploy a
  modified build.
- [`./settlement-mode.md`](./settlement-mode.md) — `TRACE_COMMONS_NEAR_SETTLEMENT_MODE`
  (`disabled` / `dry_run` / `http`), the per-request `dry_run` preview flag,
  payout designation, fail-closed holds (NoneEnrolled / AmbiguousNoDesignation),
  and idempotent hold recovery.
- [`./self-hosted-privacy-filter.md`](./self-hosted-privacy-filter.md) — bringing
  up `openai/privacy-filter` on the pilot host and cutting the privacy-filter
  backend over from `near-ai` to `self-hosted`: host resize (stops the
  instance), weight staging, the offset-convention check against real weights,
  and rollback.
- [`./a26-bakeoff-result-handler.md`](./a26-bakeoff-result-handler.md) — post-run
  handler for the A2.6 bake-off: pull the report, fill the skeleton, route to
  the A2.7 / A2.7-partial / Phase A.5 outcome branch, tear down.
- [`./a27-perplexity-floor-calibration.md`](./a27-perplexity-floor-calibration.md) —
  Outcome 1 worked procedure: pick the worst-of-passing calibration candidate,
  compute Youden's-J + p10 novel anchors, geometric-mean + 0.5× headroom, set
  `TRACE_COMMONS_GATE_PERPLEXITY_FLOOR_MICROS`, update deployment template,
  smoke-verify.
- [`./agent-traces-bakeoff-run.md`](./agent-traces-bakeoff-run.md) — operator
  activity for the A2.6 agent-traces bake-off across candidate gate models.
- [`./architecture.md`](./architecture.md) — one-page deployment topology
  (KMS, PostgreSQL, GCS, GPU host, ingest binary).
- [`./attested-inference.md`](./attested-inference.md) — taking attested
  inference from dormant to enforced: the three switches and who owns each,
  the four `TRACE_COMMONS_WITNESS_*` ingest variables and how to prove the
  running process read them, the measurement-pinning contract (every witness
  redeploy moves `compose_hash` and therefore MRCONFIGID) with the
  stale-container trap, what a contributor needs, and rollback to dormant.
- [`./audit-trail-forensics.md`](./audit-trail-forensics.md) — how to query
  and verify the audit chain when investigating a dispute or anomaly.
- [`./backup-restore.md`](./backup-restore.md) — what is backed up where,
  restore procedures, and honest RPO/RTO targets.
- [`./corpus-validity-battery.md`](./corpus-validity-battery.md) — the
  trivial-measure battery that a bake-off corpus must fail to be separated by,
  why the A2.6 corpus was separable by paragraph count alone (#204), the
  corrected same-source construction, and what passing the battery does and
  does not establish.
- [`./calibration.md`](./calibration.md) — empirical procedure for tuning
  perplexity, tail-fraction, and novelty floors (dry-run → cutover).
- [`./client-end-to-end-verification.md`](./client-end-to-end-verification.md) —
  per-platform pass over the installed contributor app: install the real
  artifact, launch it from the platform's own launcher, enroll, watch,
  preview, consent, submit, read back, withdraw, and confirm the update
  channel that install method actually uses. Produces a committed pass record
  under [`./verification-records/`](./verification-records/) which gates the
  next `app-v*` tag.
- [`./deployment.md`](./deployment.md) — end-to-end first-deploy walkthrough;
  the authoritative top-of-funnel doc.
- [`../../deploy/witness/README.md`](../../deploy/witness/README.md) — deploying
  the redaction witness in a dstack TDX guest. The project's first
  trusted-execution deployment, and the doc lives beside its compose files
  rather than here because the manifest, the image and the procedure have to
  stay in step. Covers what to pin (MRTD and MRCONFIGID, not RTMR0 or RTMR3),
  the allowlist-before-deploy upgrade order, why a guest-API surface migration
  is a key rotation and not an upgrade, that the image is **not** reproducibly
  buildable, and the limit on what a witness certificate attests.
- [`./drills.md`](./drills.md) — the full set of `/v1/admin/*-drill`
  endpoints, what each validates, and cadence guidance.
- [`./near-attestation-drill.md`](./near-attestation-drill.md) — the NEAR AI
  attestation drill: what its nine steps prove, what the paid completion
  costs, where expected measurements legitimately come from (a verified
  quote, never the endpoint's own JSON), and why a measurement mismatch after
  an image upgrade is fixed by re-pinning and never by disabling the check.
- [`./env-reference.md`](./env-reference.md) — table of every
  `TRACE_COMMONS_*` env, default, required/optional, and surface touched.

  GPU instance spend for bake-offs and corpus rebuilds.
- [`./hash-only-logging.md`](./hash-only-logging.md) — interpreting
  hash-only error classes in production logs.
- [`./hf-dataset-cache-hygiene.md`](./hf-dataset-cache-hygiene.md) — cache
  layout, disk-space requirements, and hygiene commands for the HuggingFace
  dataset and model cache used by pilot-bootstrap and the bake-off corpus
  builder.
- [`./invite-free-admission.md`](./invite-free-admission.md) — switching on
  invite-free contribution: the six `TRACE_COMMONS_ADMISSION_*` limits and why
  each value, which three are frozen into the ledger at first reservation, the
  order to enable witness and ingest in, per-step verification, rollback and
  what persists after it, and the failure modes (a missing limit refuses
  startup; a stale signer pin refuses every receipt with no useful label).
- [`./key-rotation.md`](./key-rotation.md) — Cloud KMS key-version rotation
  procedure, including drill validation and rollback.
- [Large-trace chunked scoring](large-trace-chunked-scoring.md) — chunking

- [`./mission-packages.md`](./mission-packages.md) — publish immutable
  executable mission packages, operate anonymous discovery, and interpret
  local attempt lifecycle records.

  perplexity model or embedder and the gate-version implications.
- [`./operational-summary.md`](./operational-summary.md) — field-by-field
  meaning and alarm guidance for `/v1/admin/operational-summary`.
- [`./operator-binaries.md`](./operator-binaries.md) — operator CLI
  workflows for `trace-commons-{review,admin,worker,tenant}`: install,
  env-var matrix, common sequences, defense-in-depth notes, and an
  error-variant troubleshooting table.
- [`./participant-rewards.md`](./participant-rewards.md): publish readable offers, provision account access, and inspect participant reservations and history.
- [`./pipeline-activation.md`](./pipeline-activation.md) — activation,
  containment, rollback, and legacy-writer retirement for qualified bundles.
- [`./pipeline-lab.md`](./pipeline-lab.md) — local corpus, package, report,
  catalog, and qualification workflow.
- [`./pipeline-qualification.md`](./pipeline-qualification.md) — package trust,
  operational evidence, restore checks, and promotion gates.
- [`./pii-classify-policy.md`](./pii-classify-policy.md) — `TRACE_COMMONS_PII_CLASSIFY_POLICY`
  (`all-events` / `prose-only`): the measured ~10x round-trip reduction from
  restricting the NEAR AI privacy filter to prose events, the accepted
  tool-output coverage gap, the recorded `classify_policy` /
  `events_examined` / `events_skipped_by_policy` fields, and confirming the

## Doc lifecycle and freshness

These runbooks describe how to run the system as of the most recent
Phase A retrofit. As the system evolves, individual docs can fall behind
the implementation. When a runbook and the underlying spec disagree, treat
the spec as authoritative:

- Per-slice design specs live in [`../superpowers/specs/`](../superpowers/specs/).
- Per-slice implementation plans live in [`../superpowers/plans/`](../superpowers/plans/).
- Cross-cutting contracts (envelope, storage, threat model) live in
  [`../trace-commons.md`](../trace-commons.md),
  [`../trace-commons-storage.md`](../trace-commons-storage.md), and
  [`../trace-commons-roadmap.md`](../trace-commons-roadmap.md).

If you discover a drift while running a procedure, open an issue or PR
that updates the affected runbook in the same change set that updates the
code or spec.

## What is NOT here

This directory holds operator-facing runbooks only. The following live
elsewhere:

- **Architecture and threat-model design.** See
  [`../trace-commons.md`](../trace-commons.md),
  [`../trace-commons-storage.md`](../trace-commons-storage.md), and
  [`../trace-commons-roadmap.md`](../trace-commons-roadmap.md).
- **Per-slice spec and plan documents.** See
  [`../superpowers/specs/`](../superpowers/specs/) and
  [`../superpowers/plans/`](../superpowers/plans/).
- **Implementation reports.** See
  [`../superpowers/reports/`](../superpowers/reports/).

## Audience

A single deployment operator who:
- Owns the GCP project (or other cloud) where `trace-commons-server` will run
- Has access to a GPU host (NVIDIA H100, 80 GB, single-GPU) for the gate
  service
- Is comfortable with shell + terraform-or-equivalent, but is not a Rust
  developer
- Will calibrate the gate floors empirically on the first pilot's traces
- Is the same actor as the central credit issuer (early pilot assumption —
  the central-issuer profile is a single-actor configuration)

If the operator and the central credit issuer are different actors, see
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-12-trace-kek-strategy-design.md` — the
operator-constrained trust model is Phase B work (dstack), not Phase A.

## Contents (planned)

### Orientation

- **`README.md`** *(this file)* — outline and audience.
- **`architecture.md`** — one-page deployment topology diagram: where the
  GCP project, Cloud KMS key, PostgreSQL instance, GCS bucket, GPU host,
  and (when wired) Ironclaw client live. The pieces are already specced
  individually; this stitches them into one picture.

### First deploy

- **`deployment.md`** — end-to-end walkthrough for the first deploy:
  prerequisites, GCP setup, env-var configuration, model staging,
  initial start, and what to look at in the first hour. Single
  authoritative document; everything below is referenced from here.
- **`env-reference.md`** — complete table of every `TRACE_COMMONS_*` env
  the binaries read, with default, required-or-optional flag,
  description, and which surface (KEK, gate, credit, audit) it touches.
  Generated by hand from the binary's `const TRACE_COMMONS_*` definitions
  but kept current as a stable contract.
- **`smoke-test.md`** — checklist the operator runs after first start
  AND before each subsequent deploy. Calls every `/v1/admin/*-drill`
  endpoint, runs a fixture gate evaluation, verifies all checks pass.
  Should be runnable in ~5 minutes.

### Operations

- **`key-rotation.md`** — GCP Cloud KMS key version rotation procedure.
  Covers staging a new key version, validating it via
  `/v1/admin/key-rotation-drill`, rolling the workload identity, and
  rolling back if needed. Documents the maximum claim-lifetime + refresh
  window where both keys must remain valid.
- **`model-swap.md`** — procedure for upgrading the perplexity model or
  the embedder. Covers (1) downloading + verifying the new weights,
  (2) updating `TRACE_COMMONS_PERPLEXITY_MODEL_ID` /
  `TRACE_COMMONS_EMBEDDER_MODEL_ID`, (3) what changes in the
  `gate_version_hash` and how grandfather-settled credit semantics
  apply, (4) re-calibration if the floors need adjusting.
- **`calibration.md`** — empirical procedure for tuning the perplexity,
  tail-fraction, and novelty floors. Three phases: dry-run gating
  (collect decisions without emitting credit), threshold selection
  (target a pass rate; document the trade-off), live cutover
  (`TRACE_COMMONS_NOVELTY_UTILITY_CREDIT_POINTS_DELTA` from 0 to its
  configured value). Includes guidance on collecting representative
  traces, what perplexity ranges to expect for known-novel vs
  known-duplicate inputs, and how to spot calibration drift over time.
- **`backup-restore.md`** — what's backed up where: PostgreSQL (full
  database including ledger + audit chain), GCS (encrypted artifact
  bytes), local disk (vector index files + model cache), Cloud KMS
  (out of scope — managed by GCP). Restore procedures + RPO/RTO
  targets honest about what's recoverable and what isn't.
- **`vector-replay.md`** — operator reference for the
  `trace-commons-vector-replay` recovery binary. Rebuilds a tenant's local
  vector index from `trace_gate_decisions` + the encrypted artifact
  store without touching audit/credit history. Used when the per-
  tenant `.usearch` file is corrupted, lost, or out of sync.

### Observability

- **`hash-only-logging.md`** — guide to interpreting the hash-only
  error classes (`KekUnwrapFailed`, `GateServiceUnavailable`,
  `RevocationPropagationFailure`, etc.) in production logs. For each
  class: what it means, what to check first, common root causes.
- **`operational-summary.md`** — what fields in
  `/v1/admin/operational-summary` mean and which ones should alarm.
  Includes the gate-related fields and the per-target-kind
  `revocation_propagation_terminal_failed_*` counters
  (`vector_entries`, `object_refs`, `export_manifests`,
  `export_manifest_items`, `derived_records`, `benchmark_artifacts`,
  `ranker_artifacts`, `credit_settlements`, `worker_queues`,
  `physical_delete_receipts`), gate service status reflection, etc.
- **`driver-liveness.md`** — reading
  `/v1/admin/driver-liveness`: when each background driver last
  actually succeeded, the failure-class labels and what each means
  for triage, and why `stale` catches a driver whose task died
  silently. Admin-gated on purpose; nothing alerts on it yet.
- **`drills.md`** — the full set of `/v1/admin/*-drill` endpoints,
  what each one validates, and how often to run each. Calls out
  which drills are required for promotion vs nice-to-have.

### Troubleshooting

- **`troubleshooting.md`** — common failure modes by symptom. Each
  entry: observed behavior → hash-only log signature → root cause →
  fix. Includes the GPU OOM case, the `KekContextMismatch` case
  (most common cause: tenant_ctx misconfigured), the
  `EmbedderInferenceFailed` case (most common cause: model file
  missing), etc.
- **`audit-trail-forensics.md`** — how to read the audit chain when
  something went wrong: which tables to query, how to verify the
  hash chain, how to correlate a credit dispute back to its
  triggering submission and gate decision.

### Deferred (Phase B)

These docs are placeholders until the dstack migration:

- `dstack-migration.md` — operator procedure for moving from Phase A
  (cloud-KMS-rooted) to Phase B (dstack-attested-enclave-rooted).
- `attestation-verification.md` — how to validate attestation tokens
  in the live deployment.

## Deployment scripts (planned)

These live in `scripts/operator/` (separate from `scripts/` if that
already holds dev scripts). All idempotent, all hash-only-logging,
all callable from the runbook docs.

- **`scripts/operator/stage-models.sh`** — download Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  via `huggingface-cli` and BGE-large via `fastembed`'s cache mechanism,
  then verify SHA256 against pinned expected values. Refuses on hash
  mismatch.
- **`scripts/operator/smoke-gate.sh`** — runs every required
  `/v1/admin/*-drill` endpoint, records rollout-smoke evidence, then
  hits `POST /v1/workers/gate/evaluate` with a fixture submission
  and asserts the response shape. Exits 0 on success, 1 with a
  hash-only diagnostic on first failure.
- **`scripts/operator/rotate-kek.sh`** — GCP Cloud KMS key version
  rotation: creates new version, runs the key-rotation drill, prints
  the rollback command in case the operator needs to revert. Doesn't
  flip the active key automatically — that's an explicit operator
  decision.
- **`scripts/operator/smoke-deploy.sh`** — meta-script that runs
  stage-models + binary start + smoke-gate in sequence. Idempotent;
  safe to re-run after a partial deploy.

## What this runbook does NOT cover

- **Infrastructure-as-code.** Terraform/Pulumi/k8s manifests are
  intentionally not in the runbook — they're deployment-shape-specific
  and a real operator typically has their own IaC stack. The runbook
  references the GCP resources by purpose ("a Cloud KMS key", "a GCS
  bucket with versioning") rather than prescribing how they're
  provisioned.
- **Ironclaw client setup.** Out of scope for this repo. The runbook
  notes where the client integration points sit (upload-claim issuer,
  `POST /v1/submissions`) but the client side is a separate
  deployment story.
- **Scaling beyond single-host.** First pilot is single-GPU,
  single-binary. Multi-host scaling is a future operational concern.
- **Phase B dstack-specific procedures.** Placeholders only; full
  content lands with the dstack migration.

## When to update this runbook

- A new `TRACE_COMMONS_*` env is added: update `env-reference.md`.
- A new `/v1/admin/*-drill` endpoint is added: update `drills.md` +
  `smoke-test.md` + `scripts/operator/smoke-gate.sh`.
- A new hash-only error class is introduced: update
  `hash-only-logging.md`.
- A model is swapped in production: don't update the runbook — the
  procedure stays the same. The deployment-specific notes go in the
  operator's own change log.

## Open questions for the pilot-prep PR

When the audit-fixes PR merges and the full runbook gets written,
these are the open questions to resolve:

1. **GCP-only or cloud-agnostic in the runbook?** A1 ships GCP KMS;
   AWS / Azure are deferred. The runbook can either be GCP-specific
   (concrete, useful for the first pilot) or cloud-agnostic with a
   GCP appendix (more general, less useful). Recommendation:
   GCP-specific in v1; a cloud-agnostic refactor happens when a
   second cloud's KMS adapter exists.
2. **Should `smoke-gate.sh` actually emit credit?** Or stay in
   dry-run? Probably dry-run by default with an explicit
   `--enable-credit` flag for the first real production run.
3. **Calibration data source?** First pilot has no traces to
   calibrate against. The runbook should be honest that the first
   week's floors are educated guesses, with re-calibration after
   ~1000 real traces are gated.
