# Pipeline activation and migration

Pipeline activation routes the qualified pipeline for new submissions. Retained
legacy records stay readable. The switch assigns each receipt to one
implementation.

The pipeline now has these properties:

- A receipt ownership record selects the legacy executor or the pipeline.
- A retry of a pre-switch receipt returns the original operation.
- It does not start a new pipeline run.
- Unique ledger source keys prevent both paths from awarding the same receipt.
- Tenant routing is an explicit record. Timestamps do not select the bundle.
- Activation and expansion require current drills, readiness, corpus
  evidence, credit reconciliation, index checks, and invalidation checks.
- Rollback selects an earlier qualified bundle for later runs only.
- An unsafe bound policy must be suspended. The run keeps its package.
- First-rollout containment stops new pipeline receipts. Workers and
  packages remain available.
- Legacy writers disable only after their pending owned work completes.
- Destructive schema cleanup is not part of this phase.

## Rehearse the switch

Set `TRACE_COMMONS_PG_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL test database.
Then run this command:

```bash
cargo test -p trace-commons-server --test versioned_pipeline_pg pipeline_activation
```

The tests cover mixed legacy and pipeline records, exact replay of a
pre-switch receipt, unique ledger sources, tenant expansion gates,
rollback, containment, suspension instead of rebinding, and writer
retirement after pending work completes.

The [local pipeline lab](pipeline-lab.md) `qualify` command runs this suite as part of pipeline qualification. Lab corpus and package evidence remains in local files;
these PostgreSQL integration tests remain separate schema and recovery checks.

## Local operator routes

`trace-commons-pipeline-local` adds these routes:

- `POST /v1/pipeline/switched-submissions`
- `GET /v1/admin/pipeline-routing`
- `POST /v1/admin/pipeline-contain`
- `POST /v1/admin/pipeline-retire-legacy-writer`

The existing corpus paths still submit directly to the pipeline executor.
The switched route is the dual-path receipt used during migration.

## Current completion

The redesign is complete for the contracts that are not deferred.
`SCR-005` remains deferred until the external valuation protocol exists.
New valuation rules use a later bundle through the same qualification and
activation process.
