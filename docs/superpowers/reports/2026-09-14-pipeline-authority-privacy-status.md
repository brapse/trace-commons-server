# Pipeline authority and privacy implementation status

The authority and privacy milestone adds authority and privacy controls to the local versioned pipeline.
The Score policy stays fixed.

The pipeline now has these properties:

- Admission validates the schema, contribution path, consent, allowed uses,
  authority, privacy risk, tombstones, and limits.
- Admission returns `Admit`, `Quarantine`, or `Reject`.
- PostgreSQL applies tenant and principal limits across service instances.
- An exact receipt replay does not consume another limit unit.
- Review transforms content and stores the encrypted result before commit.
- A quarantined run requires a leased human assessment.
- The bound Review policy uses the assessment as evidence.
- Each phase checks policy and lifecycle state before work and during commit.
- An operator can suspend, resume, or terminate a bound policy.
- A suspension does not consume retry attempts or change the bundle.
- A withdrawal before Settle forces index exclusion.
- A withdrawal does not remove credit from a committed Score outcome.
- A withdrawal after an index write queues an index invalidation.

## Run the corpus

Run this command:

```bash
scripts/operator/run-minimal-pipeline-corpus.sh
```

The command starts PostgreSQL 17. It operates the server with a non-owner
runtime role.

The command writes these reports:

- `.local/pipeline-report-v4.json`
- `.local/pipeline-report-v4.md`

The corpus includes Admission approval, quarantine, and rejection. It also
includes Review approval, rejection, and content transformation.

## Run the PostgreSQL tests

Set `TRACE_COMMONS_PG_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL test database. Then
run this command:

```bash
cargo test -p trace-commons-server --test versioned_pipeline_pg
```

The authority and privacy tests cover concurrent limits, review leases, policy suspension,
withdrawal ordering, credit retention, and index invalidation.

## Current limits

This path remains local and test only. The Score amount stays fixed.

The production quarantine age and remediation policy remain open. This local
path requires a leased assessment and has no production activation.

The compatibility milestone adds the production compatibility Score policy. See
[pipeline compatibility status](./2026-09-14-pipeline-compatibility-status.md).
