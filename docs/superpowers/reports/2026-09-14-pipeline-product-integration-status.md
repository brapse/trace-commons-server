# Pipeline product integration status

The product integration milestone connects the versioned pipeline to contributor, customer, worker, and
operator interfaces. The legacy product interfaces remain available for
retained records.

The pipeline now has these properties:

- Contributor status comes from runs, outcomes, credit batches, and payout
  state.
- Processing, credit, and payout use separate response fields.
- Status batches accept no more than 500 submission identifiers.
- An unrelated principal cannot detect a submission through the status
  interface.
- Signed score attestations identify the run, Score outcome, schema, and
  bundle.
- Customer exports select approved and operable registry revisions.
- Each export uses an immutable source snapshot and a stable source-list hash.
- Export items retain the view schema, consent, source revision, and bundle.
- A retry with the same request key returns the same export snapshot.
- Withdrawal writes a hash-only tombstone and invalidates managed export
  membership.
- Withdrawal keeps committed credit and reports known managed distribution.
- Object removal uses the existing bounded revocation queue.
- Index invalidation stops after five unsuccessful attempts.
- The lifecycle summary reports terminal index invalidation errors.
- Disabled community interfaces continue to return not-found responses.

## Public staging interfaces

`trace-commons-pipeline-local` has compatibility routes for the staging demonstration:

- `POST /v1/traces`
- `DELETE /v1/traces/{submission_id}`
- `POST /v1/contributors/me/submission-status`
- `GET /v1/contributors/me/credit`
- `GET /v1/contributors/me/credit-events`
- `GET /v1/contributors/me/score-attestation`
- `GET /.well-known/trace-commons-attestation-keyset.json`

The staging runner also has scoped export, lifecycle, review, and worker
routes. Local static tokens cannot satisfy production readiness.

## Run the corpus

Run this command:

```bash
bash scripts/operator/run-product-pipeline-corpus.sh
```

The report includes the public processing, credit, and payout states. The
command uses PostgreSQL and encrypted local artifacts.

## Run the PostgreSQL tests

Set `TRACE_COMMONS_PG_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a PostgreSQL test database. Then
run this command:

```bash
cargo test -p trace-commons-server --test versioned_pipeline_pg
```

The product integration tests cover status authority, signed provenance, export snapshots,
withdrawal, and terminal invalidation errors.

## Current limits

This path is a staging candidate. Pipeline qualification adds package trust, the deployment
inventory, restore tests, and promotion evidence.

See [pipeline qualification runbook](../../operator/pipeline-qualification.md).
