# Build and run environment for the Linux contributor shell.
#
# The shell is a GTK 4 / libadwaita application, so it cannot be built on a
# macOS or Windows host at all. This image is the reproducible Linux
# toolchain: everything the crate links against, plus Xvfb and a session bus
# so the application can actually be started headlessly rather than only
# compiled.
#
# Versions here are what Debian bookworm ships: GTK 4.8.3 and libadwaita
# 1.2.2. That is deliberately an old-but-widely-deployed pair -- if the shell
# builds and runs against it, it runs on the distributions contributors
# actually have. Do not raise the base image to get newer GTK without
# checking what that costs in reach.
