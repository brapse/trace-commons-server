# Build and run the Linux contributor shell inside a container.
#
# The shell links GTK 4 and libadwaita, so it does not build on the macOS
# host this repository is usually developed on. This script is the whole
# incantation: it builds the toolchain image once, keeps Cargo's registry and
# target directory in named volumes so rebuilds are incremental, and runs
# whatever command you give it inside the crate directory.
#
#   scripts/linux-build.sh                    # cargo build
#   scripts/linux-build.sh cargo clippy       # anything else
#   scripts/linux-build.sh --shell            # interactive shell
#   scripts/linux-build.sh --run-headless     # start the app under Xvfb
#   scripts/linux-build.sh --probe            # talk to a throwaway daemon
#
# Nothing here touches the host toolchain, and the host workspace still
# builds on macOS because the GTK crate is excluded from it.
